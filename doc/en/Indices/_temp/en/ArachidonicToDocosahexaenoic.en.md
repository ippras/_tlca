# Arachidonic to Docosahexaenoic Ratio

$$\frac{C20:4(n - 6)}{C20:5(n - 3)}$$

* **Abbreviation**: ARA/DHA
* **Description**: Indicates the specific balance between the key omega-6 (Arachidonic Acid, ARA) and omega-3 (Docosahexaenoic Acid, DHA) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. This ratio is particularly critical during early life for proper neural and immune system development, aiming to replicate the composition of human breast milk.
    * ARA is the second most important fatty acid in the brain. It is essential for the growth and repair of neurons, vascular health, and, crucially, for the development and modulation of the immune system. It is the precursor to eicosanoids—signaling molecules that regulate inflammation, blood clotting, and vascular tone.
    * DHA is the primary structural fatty acid in the brain and retina. It plays a key role in the development and function of neurons, ensuring cell membrane fluidity for efficient signal transmission. It is also essential for neurogenesis (the creation of new neurons) and protecting the brain from oxidative stress. It is the precursor to docosanoids, such as resolvins and protectins—signaling molecules that have powerful anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties.
* **Range**: Experts generally agree that ARA should be provided in at least equal or greater concentrations than that of supplemental DHA to mimic the composition of breastmilk ([Richard (2016)], [Forsyth (2018)], [Koletzko (2020)]).
